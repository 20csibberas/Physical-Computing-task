A Micro Controller is a device used to controll electric circuits.
It uses a processer to decide where the current should be flowing.
Examples of Micro Controllers:

# Sensors
Sensors are a big element to physical computing, how can you make a computer operate around a physical enviroment, when it has no means in which to react to the world around it? Sensors bridge the gap between the digital world inside a computer and to our physical world, by getting reactions (like light and heat) from our world and streaming data as input to the computer. Common examples of sensors are heat sensors:

# actuator
In short, an actuator turns the received electricty into physical motion or force, but their applocations are alot more complicated. Computers can make desissions, but without any actuators, the computer can not interact with the world around it, instead it will have to prompt you to do everything it was meant to do. Examples of actuators are electrical motors:

# software
software is installed into the microcontroller, in order to set its coding. Software is used as instructions for the operation of the micro controller, software can range from operating systems to lib
