A Micro Controller is a device used to controll electric circuits.
It uses a processer to decide where the current should be flowing.
Examples of Micro Controllers:

# Sensors
Sensors are a big element to physical computing, how can you make a computer operate around a physical enviroment, when it has no means in which to react to the world around it? Sensors bridge the gap between the digital world inside a computer and to our physical world, by getting reactions (like light and heat) from our world and streaming data as input to the computer. Common examples of sensors are heat sensors:

# actuator
In short, an actuator turns the received electricty into physical motion or force, but their applocations are alot more complicated. Computers can make desissions, but without any actuators, the computer can not interact with the world around it, instead it will have to prompt you to do everything it was meant to do. Examples of actuators are electrical motors:

# software
software is installed into the microcontroller, in order to set its coding. Software is used as instructions for the operation of the micro controller, software can range from operating systems to librarys and applocations. Examples of these types of software are operating systems:

![operating systems](http://cdn2.itpro.co.uk/sites/itpro/files/styles/article_main_wide_image/public/2017/02/linux_copy.jpg?itok=fellptYe)
linux is a very popular operating system amoung the computer DIY comunity, Since its usually alot cheaper and customizable than its windows and apple counterparts.

Librarys:
![time.h](http://yazilimagiris.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/illu_time-h-et-ses-fonctions.png)
time.h is a very common library that many of our devices use. From its title, its job is to calculate the time. Although time.h is very old, and modern devices would probably use some other library.

Applocations:
![microsoft word](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4f/Microsoft_Word_2013_logo.svg/2000px-Microsoft_Word_2013_logo.svg.png)
Microsoft word is an applocation which billions of people will be familiar with, it used to be the only word processor people would work with. Today we have word processors like google-docs which borrows elements from Microsoft Word, but operates in new and refined ways.

# analog and digital signals
the difference between analog and digital signals put simply is analog signals would be the physical world around us, and how the sensors are effected, then the digital signals would just be the machine language the sensors would send to the micro controller. But for a better definition of the differences between analog and digital signal; analog works in waves, the information is stored in the differences of waves high and frequencies. While Digital uses multiple electric connections, and uses combinations of current into these multiple connections to communicate.

# fantasy device
Making up any fantasy device, I would make a DNA altering microwave. It would be a microwave that people could fit in if they crawld up into a ball. but before you hop in, you must enter a pre-historic DNA trait that humans no longer have. Once entered, the micro wave will subject the user with the right amount and frequency of radiantion, to alter the persons DNA coding, to give them the evolutionary trait we once had. One problem would be our traits to choose from, im pretty sure the animals we evolved from couldn't do anything cool like fly or teleport, but atleast we can remove the part of human DNA for facial hair growth so we dont have to shave. (Or atlease shave once every five months)
