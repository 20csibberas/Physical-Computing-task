A Micro Controller is a device used to controll electric circuits.
It uses a processer to decide where the current should be flowing.
Examples of Micro Controllers:

#Sensors
Sensors are a big element to physical computing, how can you make a computer operate around a physical enviroment, when it has no means in which to react to the world around it? Sensors bridge the gap between the digital world inside a computer and to our physical world, by getting reactions (like light and heat) from our world and streaming data as input to the computer. Common examples of sensors are heat sensors:
